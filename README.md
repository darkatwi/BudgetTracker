# BudgetTracker 💰

A simple, front‑end personal budget tracker built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Allows you to log incomes and expenses, track your current balance, and manage your budget — no backend required.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Add income and expense entries (with title and amount)  
- See running balance, total incomes, and total expenses  
- Remove entries when needed  
- Data is stored locally using `localStorage` (so it persists across page reloads)  
- Clean and minimal design — works offline, no server needed  

---

## 🏁 Getting Started / How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darkatwi/BudgetTracker.git
   cd BudgetTracker
````

2. Open **`index.html`** in your browser (double‑click or use a local server)
3. Start adding incomes or expenses — your balance will update automatically

> Optionally: If you want a local dev server (useful for some browsers), run something like:
>
> ```bash
> # Python 3 example
> python -m http.server 8000
> ```
>
> Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🛠️ Why It’s Useful

Even though this is a simple app, it helps you:

* Keep track of your money — see where you spend and save
* Practice front‑end web development (HTML / CSS / JS)
* Have a small, clean, working portfolio project

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add categories for expenses (food, bills, entertainment…) and filter by category
* Add export/import (CSV or JSON) to backup or transfer data
* Add monthly/weekly summaries or charts (e.g. using Chart.js)
* Add dark mode / responsive design improvements
